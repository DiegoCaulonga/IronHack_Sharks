# IronHack_Sharks
Repositorio para mi Proyecto 1 de IronHack
In this project i have developed two different studies. Each one has its own procedures and reasonings. Their name are:
-First study: Gender provoking skills.
-Secon study: Sharks hungry hour.

#Gender Provoking skills.
In this study, i have analysed the relationship between the provoked attacks, and the gender of its "responsibles". 
I firstly uploaded the DataSet, to then dwarf it, by using only the interesting columns i could observe. Then, i simplified the set by eliminating the duplicate rows. I also eliminated the rows with more than 5 nule values, to have a more clear idea of what i was working with. After making a global clean of the DataSet, i noticed that there were several types of non provoking situations in the study, so i decided to unify them, and divide this column only between two possibilities: provoked and non provoked shark attacks. I then compared this provoked attacks with the gender of their protagonists, to notice that MORE THAN THE 80% OF THE CHARACTERS WHO SUFFERED THIS ATTACKS ARE MALES. 

#Sharks Hungry Hour
In this study, i have analysed the relationship between the hour of the day,and the number of attacks in it. 
I firstly inserted the DataSet, to continue by selecting interesting columns, and deleting duplicates again. Then, i defined a Time column cleaner function, to then apply it to it, transforming the dirty hour information, into a 24 only different answers set, with no minutes or strings, to make the information more clear. i then analysed the number of attacks depending ont he hours, to notice that 11:00 IN THE MORNING IS THE SHARKS HUNGRY HOUR.
